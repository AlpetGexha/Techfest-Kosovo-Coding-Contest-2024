### Level 8

## Youre the looter

The device speaks out loud: "You have registered for the loot's race". Suddenly you understand, that the device was the
registration for the game and she wasn't a looter before you made her one - you get scared, especially as a crypto stick
appears in your hand with a crazy amount of cybercoins on them.

You need to encrypt the loot as fast as possible so that safe transport is possible, you are in this with Lara now. You
get out your laptop to encrypt the loot to make it safe for transport.

As you don't have the resources for more complex encryption, you decide to use a simple algorithm to encrypt the loot.
You decide to use the MurmurHash3 algorithm, which is a non-cryptographic hash function suitable for general hash-based
lookup to be your passcode for the loot.

### Question

Generate the murmur hash as the 128-bit hash on x86 architecture to get the password based on the loot data, what is the
hash so you have a safe transport?
